     Add New Columns: Include columns for Month and Day of Week based on the transaction date.
     Extract Hour: Add a column to extract the hour from the transaction timestamp.
2. Explore Data with Pivot Tables
     Revenue by Month: Insert a pivot table showing revenue for each month.
     Transactions by Day of Week & Hour of Day: Add two pivot tables on the same sheet to display the number of transactions by Day of Week and Hour of Day.
     Transactions by Product Category: Add a pivot table showing the number of transactions by product category, sorted in descending order.
     Top 15 Product Types: Add a pivot table showing transactions and revenue by product type, sorted in descending order, and filtered to show the top 15 product types based on transactions.
3. Build a Dynamic Dashboard
     Add Pivot Charts: Create charts (line chart for revenue by month, column charts for transactions by day of week and hour of day, and bar chart for transactions by product category).
     Dashboard Layout: Arrange the pivot charts into a dashboard layout with space allocated for the pivot table showing the top 15 product types.
     Add Slicer: Include a slicer for store location and link it to all pivot tables on the sheet.
     Finalize Formatting: Adjust alignment, formatting, and visual elements to polish the dashboard for presentation.

Outcome:
1. Revenue Trends: Identifying revenue fluctuations by month will help pinpoint peak periods and seasonal trends, enabling better resource allocation and targeted marketing.
2. Transaction Patterns: Understanding transaction volumes by day of week and hour can guide staffing, store hours, and promotional strategies to maximize sales during high-traffic periods.
3. Product Preferences: Insights into the most popular product categories and top-performing product types can inform inventory management and assist in optimizing product offerings.
4. Store Performance: Using location-based slicers can highlight regional differences in sales, enabling more tailored marketing strategies and operational adjustments for different store locations.
